# odin-recipes
Greetings young one this is your first recipe website. For this we are going to use HTML.

Features From HTML:
  -img tags for photos of the food were cooking
  -p tags for paragraphs describing the food
  -a tags with href for links to more info or sources i got recipes from

These are some basic things but we gotta start from 0 and work our way up.
